```assembly
cmp ax, 0
je division_by_zero_handler ; Jump if AX is 0
mov dx, 0 ; Set DX to 0 for the division
div ax
jmp after_division

division_by_zero_handler:
; Handle the division by zero error appropriately
; This could involve logging, returning an error code, or taking other corrective actions
mov ax, -1 ; Return an error code

after_division:
; Continue with the program
```
This improved code first checks if `ax` is zero using `cmp` and `je` instructions.  If it is zero, the code jumps to a `division_by_zero_handler` where the error is handled gracefully.  Otherwise, the division proceeds normally.
