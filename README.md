# Assembly: Unexpected Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Assembly programming: a division by zero error that can occur unexpectedly.

The `bug.asm` file contains code that showcases the problem. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a solution to avoid the division by zero exception.

The error arises from the use of the `div` instruction without proper checks for a zero divisor.
