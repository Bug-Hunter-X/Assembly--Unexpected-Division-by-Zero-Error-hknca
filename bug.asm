```assembly
mov ax, bx
add ax, cx
mov dx, ax
mov ax, 0x1000
div ax
```

This code snippet demonstrates a potential division by zero error in Assembly.  If the value in `ax` (0x1000) becomes zero before the `div` instruction, a divide-by-zero exception will occur. This can happen if the `add ax, cx` instruction results in a value of 0 for ax.
